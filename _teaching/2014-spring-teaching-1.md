I am teaching an undergraduate-level course on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Notre Dame in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. This course provides a comprehensive overview of the HCI field, including its history, principles, methodologies, and key challenges. Students will work on projects applying these concepts to design and develop functional interface prototypes. I will provide mentorship and feedback throughout the semester.
