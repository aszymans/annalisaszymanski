I am teaching an undergraduate-level course on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This course offers an in-depth exploration of the HCI field, covering its history, goals, principles, methodologies, successes, failures, open problems, and emerging areas. Throughout the semester, students work on a project where they apply the principles and techniques learned in the course to design, implement, and evaluate a functional interface prototype. I advise students on their projects, providing guidance and feedback to help them successfully navigate the design and implementation process.
